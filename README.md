# MarvelPoc
Android Test for Candidates

Here at Zinio, we think Marvel rocks.

Objectives:

• Create an Android application that communicates with the Marvel API and meets the

following requirements:

• As a user I want to retrieve marvel’s characters and show them in a grid.
• As a user I want to see more information about the character in a new screen

(name, description and thumbnail).

• As a user I want to mark a character as a favorite.
• As a user I want to keep my favorites characters stored in the device.
• We encourage the usage of 3rd party libraries or frameworks. Please add the reason

why you are using them and the pros and cons.

We will evaluate:

• Architecture design.
• Java skills.
• Code quality.
• Usage of the latest native Android components.
• Responsive UI.
• Project structure.

Bonus Points:

• Clean architecture.
• Unit Tests.
• Documentation.
• Nice little big details.
